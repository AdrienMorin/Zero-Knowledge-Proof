\section{Application of Zero-Knowledge Proofs}

Zero-Knowledge Proofs are a groundbreaking cryptographic primitive with wide-ranging applications.\cite{chainlink2024} They allow for secure, private, and efficient authentication and verification without disclosing sensitive information. Below are some of the key areas where ZKPs demonstrate their real utility.

\subsection{Privacy-Preserving Authentication}

ZKPs play a crucial role in privacy-preserving authentication systems \cite{bhattacharya2024}, where one party needs to prove their identity or the validity of a credential without revealing the underlying data. For instance, a user may want to prove that they are over the age of 18 without disclosing their exact birthdate. ZKPs can facilitate this by allowing the user to provide proof of their age without sharing any other personal information.
\\
In the context of password-based authentication, ZKPs can be used to prove knowledge of a password without sending the password itself over the network. This eliminates the risk of password interception during transmission, thereby protecting users from man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and credential theft.

\subsection{Verifiable Computation and Cloud Services}

In cloud computing, users often delegate computation to remote servers, which raises concerns about trust and the integrity of the computed results. ZKPs can provide verifiable computation, allowing cloud providers to prove that they have performed a computation correctly without revealing the underlying data or computation process. This is particularly important in sensitive fields such as medical data analysis, financial auditing, and confidential research.
\\
For example, a hospital may want to outsource medical image analysis to a third-party cloud provider. Using ZKPs, the cloud provider can prove that the analysis was performed correctly without revealing the medical data itself. This ensures both privacy and correctness in outsourced computations.

\subsection{Digital Voting Systems}

In electronic voting systems, privacy and security are paramount. Voters need to prove that they have cast a legitimate vote, while also ensuring the secrecy of their ballot. ZKPs can be employed in digital voting systems to provide proof that a vote was counted without revealing the vote itself.
\\
Zero-Knowledge Proofs allow for secure and private elections, where votes can be tallied without exposing individual voter preferences. Moreover, voters can verify that their vote was counted correctly without revealing their choice to anyone else, ensuring both the privacy of the vote and the integrity of the election process.

\subsection{Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies}

One of the most notable applications of ZKPs is in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum allow for pseudonymous transactions, but the transaction details are still visible on the public blockchain. This lack of privacy can be problematic in cases where users want to hide transaction amounts or counterparties for legitimate reasons.
\\
ZKPs, such as zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge), are employed in privacy-centric cryptocurrencies like Zcash. They allow users to prove that they have sufficient funds for a transaction without revealing the specific amount or the details of the transaction. This preserves user privacy while ensuring the integrity of the transaction.
\\
Moreover, zk-Rollups, a layer-2 scalability solution, leverage ZKPs to batch multiple transactions into a single proof, reducing the data that needs to be stored on the blockchain. This improves scalability and lowers transaction costs, while maintaining the privacy and security of individual transactions.

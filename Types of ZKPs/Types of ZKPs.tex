\section{Types of Zero-Knowledge Proofs}

\subsection{Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (IZKPs)}
Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs involve back-and-forth communication between the Prover and the Verifier. The Verifier sends challenges to the Prover, who must then respond with correct answers based on their knowledge of the secret. After a series of interactions, the Verifier is convinced of the Prover's knowledge without learning the secret.

\subsubsection{An Example: Fiat-Shamir protocol explained in the previous section. Another one interesting : The Graph Isomorphism Problem}
The Prover claims that they can transform Graph \( G_1 \) into Graph \( G_2 \), meaning the two graphs are isomorphic. The Prover knows the isomorphism function, but doesn’t reveal it. The interaction proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Verifier randomly permutes \( G_1 \) or \( G_2 \) and sends the permuted graph \( H \) to the Prover.
    \item The Prover identifies which graph was permuted and shows the isomorphism between the permuted graph and either \( G_1 \) or \( G_2 \).
    \item This is repeated many times to ensure the Verifier’s confidence.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Strengths:} Simple, well-studied protocol.\\
\textbf{Weaknesses:} Requires multiple rounds of communication, which can be impractical for certain applications.

\subsection{Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZKPs)}
Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs remove the need for interaction between the Prover and the Verifier. The Prover can generate a proof that the Verifier can check later without further communication. This is especially useful in settings like blockchain, where Verifiers cannot interact with Provers directly.

\subsubsection{Example: zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge)}
zk-SNARKs are a type of NIZKP that are used in privacy-preserving blockchain systems, such as Zcash. They enable efficient, non-interactive proofs that are small and quick to verify. The Prover constructs a proof using a secret (e.g., a private transaction) that the Verifier can later check to ensure the transaction was valid without learning any details about it.
\justify
\textbf{Strengths:} Efficient, widely used in blockchain and privacy applications.\\
\textbf{Weaknesses:} Requires a trusted setup phase where initial parameters are generated securely. If this setup is compromised, the system’s security could be at risk.

\subsection{zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge)}
zk-STARKs are a more recent development that addresses some of the limitations of zk-SNARKs, particularly the need for a trusted setup. zk-STARKs rely on cryptographic primitives such as hash functions, making them more transparent and scalable.

\textbf{Advantages of zk-STARKs over zk-SNARKs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transparency:} zk-STARKs do not require a trusted setup.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} zk-STARKs are designed to handle larger proofs and are more efficient in terms of computational complexity.
    \item \textbf{Post-Quantum Security:} zk-STARKs use hash functions, which are believed to be resistant to quantum computing attacks.
\end{itemize}

However, zk-STARKs tend to produce larger proofs than zk-SNARKs, making them slightly less practical for some applications where bandwidth is limited.

\subsubsection{Example: Verifiable Computation}
Imagine a cloud service provider wants to prove to a client that a computation was performed correctly without revealing the inputs or outputs of the computation. zk-STARKs can be used to provide this proof, ensuring the integrity of the computation while preserving privacy.

\subsection{Zero-Knowledge Range Proofs (ZKRP)}
Zero-Knowledge Range Proofs allow the Prover to prove that a number lies within a certain range without revealing the number itself. This is particularly useful in financial applications, where the Prover might want to prove they have sufficient funds without disclosing the exact amount.

\subsubsection{Example: Confidential Transactions in Cryptocurrencies}
In a cryptocurrency transaction, a user may want to prove that the amount being sent is within a valid range (e.g., greater than zero and less than their total balance) without revealing the exact amount. ZKRP allows this by constructing a proof that the transaction amount is within the allowed range, while keeping the specific amount hidden.

\justify
\textbf{Strengths:} Useful for privacy-preserving applications in finance.\\
\textbf{Weaknesses:} Proof generation can be computationally expensive.

\subsection{Zero-Knowledge Succinct Transparent Argument of Knowledge (zk-STARK)}
zk-STARKs differ from zk-SNARKs in that they provide scalability and transparency. They don't require a trusted setup, which makes them highly valuable in decentralized environments where trust is difficult to establish. Moreover, zk-STARKs have proven to be resilient against quantum computing attacks due to their reliance on hash-based cryptography.

\justify
\textbf{Strengths:} No trusted setup, post-quantum security, scalable for large proofs.\\
\textbf{Weaknesses:} Larger proof sizes than zk-SNARKs, higher bandwidth requirements.
